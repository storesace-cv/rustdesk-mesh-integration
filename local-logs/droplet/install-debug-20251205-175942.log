   We detected TypeScript in your project and reconfigured your tsconfig.json file for you.
   The following suggested values were added to your tsconfig.json. These values can be changed to fit your project's needs:

   	- include was updated to add '.next/types/**/*.ts'
   	- include was updated to add '.next/dev/types/**/*.ts'
   	- plugins was updated to add { name: 'next' }

   The following mandatory changes were made to your tsconfig.json:

   	- jsx was set to react-jsx (next.js uses the React automatic runtime)
