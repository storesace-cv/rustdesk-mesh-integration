# v0.1.0 — SoT alignment, Edge Functions & deploy automation

This release aligns the repository with the Source of Truth (SoT) documents and introduces deployment automation and Supabase Edge Functions.

Highlights
- Supabase Edge Functions: `get-devices`, `login`, `register-device`, `remove-device`, `auth` (token validation and device lookup).
- Database migration: `supabase/migrations/0001_initial.sql` (tables, policies, and view `android_devices_expanded`).
- Deployment automation: `deploy/` scripts for CI and non-interactive deploys; credential templates and helpers.
- Frontend adjustments to match SoT.

Notes
- The release tag `v0.1.0` was created and pushed to `origin/main`.
- `auth` now validates Bearer tokens via Supabase Auth and returns linked `mesh_users` and `android_devices_expanded`.

Upgrade / Deploy
- To deploy locally: see `deploy/README` (or use `deploy/supabase-deploy-prompt.sh`).

If you want a formal GitHub Release entry created (with the `v0.1.0` tag), I can create it next; this file is a release note stored in the repo for traceability.
